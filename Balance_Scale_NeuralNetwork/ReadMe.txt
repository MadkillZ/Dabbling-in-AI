Just run the run.bat file to run the program. I made use 4 inputs, 2 hidden layers (6,3) and 2 outputs. Just make sure to check the brackets when inputting training and test data.

the program will generate an output.txt with the weights of all the layers. This is currently specialized towards the balanced-scale data set but could be adjusted for about anything.
